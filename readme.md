The non-sucking key mapper that works on Wayland, by hooking into `/dev/input`.

`src/codes.rs` contains some constants found in Linux x64 5.4.2 headers, but I'm not sure how stable they are. If by any
chance those magic numbers changed, the file can be regenerated by:

```sh
$ gcc sys/codegen.c && ./a.out > src/codes.rs
``` 

[evtest](https://github.com/freedesktop-unofficial-mirror/evtest) is a great tool to help find out the code and name of a key.
